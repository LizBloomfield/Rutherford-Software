GPIO.setup(23, GPIO.OUT)

#This command says a voltage of 3.3V (HIGH) or 0V (LOW) should be applied.

#either output 0 (if button not pressed) or 1 (if button pressed).

#i2c output for GPIO

#You can verify the address of connected I2C peripherals with a simple one-liner:
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
sudo i2cdetect -y 1

#You can then access I2C from Python using the smbus library:
import smbus
DEVICE_BUS = 1
DEVICE_ADDR = 0x15
bus = smbus.SMBus(DEVICE_BUS)
bus.write_byte_data(DEVICE_ADDR, 0x00, 0x01)
#GPIO 0 and GPIO 1 - I2C0 - can be used as an alternate I2C bus, but are typically used by the system to read the HAT EEPROM.

#To take readings from sensors:
# 1. Import the gpiozero library for Python
# 2. Read from the connected sensor (directly, or by using SPI or I2C)
# 3. Store the data (see below)

#i found some simple code for a small photocell. 
#aka resistor that changes resistance based on how bright the light is
# see if we can test this with one of our sillicon detectors tomorrow. 

#simple resistor code:
import time
import board
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction

RCpin = board.D18

while True:
    with DigitalInOut(RCpin) as rc:
        reading = 0

        rc.value = False

        time.sleep(0.1)

        # setup pin as input and wait for low value
        rc.direction = Direction.INPUT

        # This takes about 1 millisecond per loop cycle
        while rc.value is False:
            reading += 1
        print(reading)

#uses an LDR and breadboard but can see if we can tweak it
